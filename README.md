# Readme-Generator
App to generate a README 

  ## Description
  This App Will Generate a Professional README For Your Next Project. Follow The Prompts And Enter All Required Information. This app uses the GitHub Api to retrive     details given the users GitHub login. It will attempt to get the users email address in the profile, if none is avavilable then it will prompt. It will then return a   list of repos from GitHub, you can select one of those or enter a new Project name. You then follow the prompts to enter a description, installation instructions and usage details. The app will then present a list of licenses availbe in GitHub. I created my own API as the data returned from GitHub didnt return the correct information to get the badge data, as I created a API hosted https://my-json-server.typicode.com/computastar/badges-api-server/db which returns all the required data. The next prompt asks about Contributors, the app returns the contritutors if you selected a repo, select the contributors using the spacebar. If its a new Project enter your own Contributors. Enter the tests ytou require. The app will now build out the ReadMe, name README-%ProjectTitle%.md in the same folder as index.js
